ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Me, Valentin Golev, would like to thank all the contributors to the Mongodloid
project, our corporate sponsor (r00.ru), the MongoDB team for their great database,
the Zend Framework team for their great library (which isn't necessary for
Mongodloid), and you, the Mongodloid user.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you, my email is mongodloid@va1en0k.net ;-)
